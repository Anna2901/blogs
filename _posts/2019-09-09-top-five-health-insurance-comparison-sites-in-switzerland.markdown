The health insurance system in Switzerland is acknowledged for being one of the best insurance systems in Europe. Health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing in Switzerland; by birth or within three months of taking up residence there. Health Insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer. This agreement enables a guarantee of compensation for medical expenses by the insurance company to the insurer in case of any medical illness faced. The health insurance policy usually covers expenses like doctor consultation fees, medical test charges, hospitalization cost, and sometimes post-recovery charges to some extent.

According to FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority), Swiss insurance companies achieved aggregate annual profits of CHF 10.6 billion in 2018, which represents a 40% increase over the year 2017. The Swiss insurance market is growing with every passing year.
